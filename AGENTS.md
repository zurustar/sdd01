# Agent Workflow Requirements

## Mandatory Planning Checklist
- Before making any code or documentation changes, record the intended work in an existing `*todo.md` or `plans.md` file (e.g., `docs/pre_step3_todo.md`).
- Use markdown task list syntax so that each planned action appears as `[ ] Task description` prior to implementation.
- Upon completing each action, update the corresponding entry to `[v] Task description` within the same file.
- Do not mark an item as complete unless the related changes are present in the repository.

These rules apply to the entire repository and must be followed for every future contribution by agents.
