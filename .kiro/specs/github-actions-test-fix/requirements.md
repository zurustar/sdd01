# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses GitHub Actions test failures where tests pass locally but the CI process exits with error code 1, preventing successful builds and deployments.

## Glossary

- **GitHub Actions**: The continuous integration and deployment platform integrated with GitHub repositories
- **CI Pipeline**: The automated process that runs tests, builds, and deploys code changes
- **Coverage Threshold**: The minimum percentage of code that must be covered by tests
- **Exit Code**: A numeric value returned by a process to indicate success (0) or failure (non-zero)
- **Test Runner**: The system component that executes automated tests and reports results

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub Actions to pass when all tests are successful, so that I can merge my pull requests and deploy code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests pass locally, THE CI Pipeline SHALL complete successfully with exit code 0
2. WHEN test coverage meets the project requirements, THE CI Pipeline SHALL not fail due to coverage issues
3. IF a test fails, THEN THE CI Pipeline SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which tests failed
4. THE CI Pipeline SHALL run the same test commands that work in the local development environment
5. WHEN tests complete successfully, THE GitHub Actions workflow SHALL proceed to subsequent build steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test execution between local and CI environments, so that I can trust that passing tests locally will also pass in CI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Test Runner SHALL use identical Go test commands in both local and CI environments
2. THE CI Pipeline SHALL use the same Go version as specified in the project configuration
3. WHEN coverage reporting is enabled, THE CI Pipeline SHALL generate coverage reports without causing failures
4. THE Test Runner SHALL handle test timeouts consistently across environments
5. IF environment-specific configurations exist, THEN THE CI Pipeline SHALL load the appropriate settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want clear visibility into test failures and coverage metrics, so that I can ensure code quality standards are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail, THE CI Pipeline SHALL output detailed failure information including stack traces
2. THE CI Pipeline SHALL report coverage percentages for each package tested
3. IF coverage falls below thresholds, THEN THE CI Pipeline SHALL provide specific guidance on which packages need more tests
4. THE GitHub Actions workflow SHALL preserve test artifacts for debugging purposes
5. WHEN coverage analysis completes, THE CI Pipeline SHALL display coverage summaries in the workflow logs
