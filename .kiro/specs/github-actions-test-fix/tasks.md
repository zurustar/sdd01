# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Fix Go version compatibility issues
  - Update GitHub Actions workflow to use Go 1.21 instead of invalid 1.24
  - Update go.mod file to specify Go 1.21 compatibility
  - Verify all Go version references are consistent across CI configuration
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Consolidate and fix coverage threshold logic
  - [ ] 2.1 Remove separate coverage job from GitHub Actions workflow
    - Delete the standalone coverage job that duplicates test execution
    - Move coverage threshold check into the main test job
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2_
  
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement Go-native coverage calculation
    - Replace shell-based arithmetic (bc command) with Go-native calculation
    - Create coverage threshold validation that works consistently across environments
    - Add proper error handling for coverage file parsing
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 3.3_
  
  - [ ] 2.3 Update Makefile coverage targets
    - Modify Makefile to use the same coverage logic as CI
    - Ensure local coverage-check target matches CI behavior exactly
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 3. Standardize test execution across environments
  - [ ] 3.1 Create consistent test command configuration
    - Define standard test flags that work identically in local and CI environments
    - Ensure race detection and coverage flags are properly configured
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_
  
  - [ ] 3.2 Fix test artifact handling
    - Ensure coverage files are properly generated and preserved
    - Add proper cleanup of temporary test files
    - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 4. Enhance error reporting and debugging
  - [ ] 4.1 Improve CI error messages
    - Add detailed logging for coverage calculation steps
    - Include specific package coverage information in CI output
    - Provide actionable guidance when coverage thresholds are not met
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_
  
  - [ ] 4.2 Add coverage validation script
    - Create a standalone script to validate coverage calculation logic
    - Include test cases for edge scenarios (0%, 100%, boundary values)
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2_

- [ ]* 4.3 Add integration tests for CI configuration
  - Write tests to validate GitHub Actions workflow syntax
  - Create test scenarios for coverage threshold edge cases
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [ ] 5. Update documentation and validate changes
  - [ ] 5.1 Update development documentation
    - Modify README or development docs to reflect Go 1.21 requirement
    - Update coverage threshold documentation
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.5_
  
  - [ ] 5.2 Validate complete CI pipeline
    - Test the updated CI configuration with a sample pull request
    - Verify that passing tests locally also pass in CI
    - Confirm coverage reporting works correctly
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1_
