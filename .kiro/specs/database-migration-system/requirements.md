# Requirements Document

## Introduction

データベースマイグレーションシステムは、Enterprise Scheduler アプリケーションのSQLiteデータベーススキーマを安全かつ確実に管理するためのシステムです。このシステムは、アプリケーションの起動時に自動的にマイグレーションを実行し、データベースの整合性を保ちながらスキーマの変更を適用します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated database migration system, so that schema changes can be applied consistently across different environments without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically check for pending migrations
2. WHEN pending migrations exist THEN the system SHALL apply them in sequential order
3. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the transaction and prevent application startup
4. WHEN all migrations are applied successfully THEN the system SHALL log the completion status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want migration version tracking, so that the system knows which migrations have been applied and prevents duplicate execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration system initializes THEN it SHALL create a `schema_migrations` table if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN a migration is applied successfully THEN the system SHALL record the version and timestamp in `schema_migrations`
3. WHEN checking for pending migrations THEN the system SHALL compare available migration files with applied versions
4. WHEN a migration version already exists in the tracking table THEN the system SHALL skip that migration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured migration file organization, so that migrations are easy to manage and execute in the correct order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration files are created THEN they SHALL be stored in `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations` directory
2. WHEN naming migration files THEN they SHALL follow the pattern `{version}_{description}.sql` where version is sequential
3. WHEN the system scans for migrations THEN it SHALL sort files by version number in ascending order
4. WHEN a migration file is malformed THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transactional migration execution, so that partial migrations don't leave the database in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a migration THEN the system SHALL wrap it in a database transaction
2. WHEN a migration SQL statement fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the entire transaction
3. WHEN a migration completes successfully THEN the system SHALL commit the transaction and update the version tracking
4. WHEN multiple migrations are pending THEN each SHALL be executed in its own transaction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that migration issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error with migration version and SQL statement context
2. WHEN migrations start THEN the system SHALL log the number of pending migrations to be applied
3. WHEN each migration completes THEN the system SHALL log the migration version and execution time
4. WHEN the migration system encounters a file system error THEN it SHALL return a wrapped error with context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want SQLite-specific configuration, so that the database operates with optimal settings for the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing database connection THEN the system SHALL enable foreign key constraints with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`
2. WHEN connecting to SQLite THEN the system SHALL use `modernc.org/sqlite` driver for CGO-free operation
3. WHEN configuring SQLite THEN the system SHALL set appropriate timeout and busy handler settings
4. WHEN the database file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with proper permissions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an operator, I want migration status visibility, so that I can verify the current database schema version in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying migration status THEN the system SHALL provide a method to list all applied migrations with timestamps
2. WHEN the application starts successfully THEN it SHALL log the current schema version
3. WHEN migrations are skipped (already applied) THEN the system SHALL log this information
4. WHEN no migrations are pending THEN the system SHALL log that the database is up to date

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with the application lifecycle, so that the database is ready before the HTTP server starts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN migration execution SHALL complete before HTTP server initialization
2. WHEN migrations fail THEN the application SHALL exit with a non-zero status code
3. WHEN the migration system is disabled via configuration THEN the application SHALL start without running migrations
4. WHEN running in test mode THEN the system SHALL support in-memory database migration for testing
